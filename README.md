title-Anticancer activity in aqueous extract of Brassica oleracea against oral cancer cell line HSC3
It exhibits enormous antioxidant properties. Red Cabbage has widespread use in traditional medicine, in alleviation of symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders as well as in treatment of wounds and mastitis.Therefore the effect of Brassica oleracea extract on oral cancer cell line HSC-3 (Human Squamosal cell carcinoma 3) was tested. Brassica oleraceae crude extract was able to show cytotoxic effect in a dose dependent manner in cell viability assay. This was further confirmed using DAPI staining and the percentage of cells entering apoptosis and necrosis was studied using AO/EtBr staining. This preliminary study concludes that Brassica oleraceae crude extract may be considered as a novel anticancer agent in conjugative treatment providing new prospects for anticancer therapy using a natural product.The anticancer activity of brassica oleraceae was determined based on the cytotoxicity against HSC3 cell lines and apoptosis induction. Programmed cell death or apoptosis performs a essential role for balancing cell proliferation and cell death and contributes to an effective therapy. Several anticancer activity studies have defined apoptosis as the pharmaco-dynamic endpoint for anti-cancer treatment. Interestingly, the brassica oleraceae extract exhibited a higher selectivity and showed significant cytotoxicity and a high selectivity against HSC3 cells after 24 hr exposure When the concentration of brassica oleraceae extract increased, both cytotoxicity and the rate of apoptotic cells was also increased. It was indicated that the anticancer activity of brassica oleraceae was in a concentration dependent manner. The characterstic of apoptosis was also further confirmed by AO/ ETBR and DAPI staining and is an indicative of late stage of apoptosis. In conclusion, our results clearly, showed that brassica oleraceae crude extract may be considered as novel anticancer agent providing new prospects for anticancer therapy wing a natural product.
